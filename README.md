# Robust-Watermarking-2

This a secure and robust watermarking scheme based on singular values replacement and IWT transformation.

The technique is described in the following paper: https://github.com/shreyverma03/Robust-Watermarking-2/blob/master/IWT(SVd).pdf

What it does and how to use it:

If you just want to hide a logo "let's say a watermark message (a.k.a image)" inside another image then simply open "iwt_svd.m" 

Finally execute the dwt_svd.m from matlab command window and watch the figures.

Decomposition upto 1st step-4th step can be done by executing "iwt_svd.m".

Watermarked Image , Watermark Logo , Extracted Watermark all can be viewed by executing "iwt_svd.m".
